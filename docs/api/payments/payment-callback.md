# Payment Callback

When creating a payment, you can pass a `callbackUrl` parameter to the MixPay API. 


> Please checkout the [Security Guidelines](/guides/security-guidelines) first.

When creating a payment, you can pass a `callbackUrl` parameter to the API. 

`callbackUrl` only supports HTTPS and has to be [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP).

:::warning
Callback only happens when MixPay successfully received the customer's payment.
:::

## Receiving result

After payment successfully, MixPay will issue a POST request to this URL, with the following JSON content as an example:

```json
{
  "orderId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "traceId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "payeeId": "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

:::info
**For security reasons, we're not passing the payment result on purpose. You can follow the instruction below for getting the payment result.**
:::

When your callback endpoint receives a call, you MUST do the following checks:

- First, in your database, look for the incoming `orderId` or `traceId` value. **This step is essential, be careful anyone can post a fake value to your endpoint**;
- Call the [payments-results API](/api/payments/payments-results), and check for `data.status` field to be `success`;
- Check the `data.payeeId` is yours;
- Check the `data.quoteAmount` and `data.quoteAssetId` are both match your order;

:::warning
**Caution**: **Only all of the conditions we mentioned above are passed, then you can mark your order as completed.**
:::

## Response to the callback

Your endpoint should return an HTTP status 200 with the following JSON data:

```json
{  
  "code": "SUCCESS"
}
```

Anything `code` not equal to `SUCCESS`, MixPay server will see it as a failure, then our server will retry at 0s/15s/15s/30s/180s/1800s/1800s/1800s/1800s/3600s, a total 10 timesã€‚
