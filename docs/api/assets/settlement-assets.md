# Settlement Assets

## GET /setting/settlement_assets

List all the supported settlement assets.

### Endpoint URL

```
https://api.mixpay.me/v1/setting/settlement_assets
```

## Parameters

### `payeeId` | optional | String

Account ID for receiving money, pls see [Three types of account](/guides/integration-verview#three-types-of-account) and [How to get payeeId](/guides/integration-verview#payee-id).

If you want to use a specified crypto asset we not yet publiclly supported, you can [contact our customer service](/guides/contact-customer-service) and use this parameter to fetch your exclusive customized settlement asset.

### `quoteAssetId` | optional | String

`assetId` of quote cryptocurrency.

### `quoteAmount` | optional | Numeric

Corresponding to the amount of quoteAssetId, for example, the current commodity value is 10 USDT

**Notes: `quoteAmount` has to work together with `quoteAssetId`.**

In MixPay, different crypto asset supports different trading range, for example ETH support 0.01~50000 range, and less popular crypto due to less liquidity we will support less trading amount. 

MixPay uses `quoteAmount` and `quoteAssetId` to calculate the settlement-supported assets. It will respond with `isAvailable` field, if `isAvailable` is `false`, means you cannot use this asset as a settlement asset. If you use an unsupported settlement asset, we will choose the settlement asset for you, most of the time will be the quote asset.
