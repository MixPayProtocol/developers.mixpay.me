# MixPay+ integration guide

Integrate into MixPay Checkout page with your wallet payment method.

## Introduction

This document is used to guide crypto wallet App developers to integrate your payment functionality into MixPay's Checkout Page.

> You can visit this link to experience [MixPay's Checkout Page](https://mixpay.me/pay?payeeId=a0d77914-0877-6b47-eb1d-d3f94ed15d6a).

After integration, when users scan the payment QRCode with your wallet App and open the MixPay Checkout Page, they can use your wallet to pay. And the User Experience is close to App Native.

## Get started

In your app's Webview, inject the global `window.mixpayPlus` variable into our Checkout Page under the domain name `mixpay.me`.

```javascript
window.mixpayPlus = {
  appId: 'your-wallet-name',
  appName: 'XXX Pay',
  appIcon: 'https://xxxx.xxx/xxx.png', // Custom icon
  themeColor: '#fff', // Customize button background color
  assetList: [], // List of supported payment currencies
  ready: false, // Are the `pay` methods available? 
  pay: function(optionsJSON) {} // Button click triggers the callback method
}
```
