# Assets Overview

MixPay is decentralised and supports Mixin Messenger and any on-chain wallet for payments. 

MixPay is very flexible because of its underlying ability to separate the three parts of the quote, payment and settlement. MixPay supports three settlement modes simultaneously: regular user, robot, and multi-signature group.

The supported assets can be found in the following links.
