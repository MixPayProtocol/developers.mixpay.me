# Online Payment

Integrating MixPay into Online Payment takes only three steps.

## Introduction

Before you get started, all you need to know is that it takes only three steps to integrate MixPay into the Online Payment. They are as follows.

1.  Create the payment link.
2.  Place the payment link on a button.
3.  Users scan the QR code to pay, and the Online Payment look queries the payment results.

More about MixPay, you can check [this](/developers/guides/introduction) for reference.

## API Integration

Before you start, you need to know that through the API of MixPay, the crypto paid by the user is settled directly to your Mixin bot, MixPay user or Mixin Wallet.

Mixin bot and MixPay user (ID of MixPay user is equal to Mixin ID) both have the same parameter, called **UUID**. This UUID is very important and determines the destination of the money received. The assets in your Mixin bot are programmable, and the assets in MixPay you can withdraw and manage easily.

Next, we start with a detailed guide.

### Step 1 - Create the payment link

1.  There is no need to register MixPay to use MixPay API. You can just use MixPay API with your preferred languages. MixPay API click [here](/developers/api/overview).
2.  Also, you can use this bot(7000101422) to get the Mixin UUID; just send the Mixin ID in the chat window to the bot. It's simple, and no programming is required. Also, you can get this UUID via this [API](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/api/users/search), and you can click [here](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/dapp/getting-started/create-dapp) for the tutorial.
3.  The ID of cryptocurrency you need to acquire. The type of assets is used for settlement and quote. Also, you can click [here](/developers/guides/assets) for detail about supported assets.


1.  You can use this [API](/developers/api/payments/pay) to integrate with MixPay. The specific parameters are as below. And you can place the payment link on a button, and the customers scan the QR code to pay.

And the `traceId` you can generate randomly. If you use Golang, the sample code is like below.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/google/uuid"
)

func main() {
    id := uuid.New()
    fmt.Println(id.String())
}
```

Assuming the `traceId` is dd9c3e04-a5d2-11ec-b909-0242ac120002 generated by the sample code, the full sample request and parameters are below.

### Example request - Accepting Payments

You can copy the link and open it in a browser:

```
https://mixpay.me/pay?payeeId=a0d7791408776b47eb1dd3f94ed15d6a&settlementAssetId=c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa&quoteAssetId=usd&traceId=dd9c3e04-a5d2-11ec-b909-0242ac120002&remark=xxxxxx
```

### Parameters


|  Param | Optional | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payeeId` | <span class="required">*required</span> | String | Three settlement modes are supported, regular user, robot, and multisig group, so it is usually the Mixin UUID of a regular user or robot. You can also specify the multisigId of a sub-account. |
| `settlementAssetId` | optional | String | assetId of settlement cryptocurrency. Settlement assets you prefer. If left blank, the payee will receive the cryptocurrency the user pays for. |
| `quoteAssetId` | optional | String | assetId of quote cryptocurrency.|
| `quoteAmount` | optional | Numeric | Amount of cryptocurrency received, if left blank, the user can enter manually. |
| `remark` | optional | String | Payment remark viewable by the payee. |
| `traceId` | optional | String | UUID, used to prevent double payment. |

### Step 2 - Place the payment link on a button

When you've generated the payment link, you can place the payment link on a button on your website. Maybe you can use `<button>` HTML tag or create responsive buttons using JavaScript.

### Step 3 - Look query the payment results

Then you can use this [API](/developers/api/payments/payments-results) to loop query payment results. The parameter is the `traceId` you generated. And the response is the `status` of payment. The `status` has three parameters, unpaid, failed and success.

## JS Plugin

You can also integrate MixPay using the [JS Plugin](https://github.com/MixPayProtocol/mixpayjs) we provide. It helps you have a more user-friendly experience on mobile, such as automatically pulling up a wallet, and the user can select a certain wallet to pay. When the user doesn't have a wallet on their phone, they will be alerted to make a manual transfer.
