# Instant Exchange

Our MixPay API has an instant exchange feature. It allows users to have an amazingly smooth experience accepting whatever crypto they’ve set their eyes on.

## Introduction

Our MixPay API has an instant exchange feature, allowing users to have an amazingly smooth experience accepting whatever crypto they’ve set their eyes on.

Here is an overview of the integration process:

1.  Use our assets API to construct a user view;
2.  When a user makes an order, call the create payment API, using a trace ID;
3.  When getting the result, perform actions for the user to pay;
4.  When payment finish, call the get payment result API, using the same trace ID.

Let's start with a detailed guide.

## Step 1 - Use the assets API to construct a view

Use the following three API to

-   [Payment Assets](/api/assets/payment-assets) - Used to let payers choose which payment cryptocurrency they want to pay;
-   [Quote Assets](/api/assets/quote-assets) - Used when you calculate the total payment amount and show it to the user;
-   [Settlement Assets](/api/assets/settlement-assets) - Used when you are setting the payee settlement type.

## Step 2 - Create a payment

1.  There is no need to register MixPay to use MixPay API. You can just use MixPay API with your preferred languages. MixPay API click [here](/api/overview).

2.  You can use this bot(7000101422) to get the Mixin UUID; send the Mixin ID in the chat window to the bot. It's simple, and no programming is required.

3.  Also, if the user UUID you want to acquire is a MixPay user, you can get this UUID via [getting Mixin UUID API](/api/users/get-mixin-uuid).

4.  You can use [On-chain Payments](/api/payments/onchain-payments) and [Create Payments](/api/payments/accepting-payments) API to create a payment. The specific parameters are as below. And you can place the payment link on a button.

When creating a payment, you need to pass a `traceId`; with traceId, you can get the payment result using this API - [Payments Results](/api/payments/payments-results).

The `traceId` you can generate randomly; the format is UUID; you need to create this UUID, and then store it in your orders database table for future to use, for example, checking the crypto payment result.

If you are using Golang, you can generate the UUID as below:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/google/uuid"
)

func main() {
    id := uuid.New()
    fmt.Println(id.String())
}
```

:::info
Tip: Please note that** **`traceId`** **has to be unique in your system; it's like order id but in UUID format.
:::

Assuming the `traceId` is dd9c3e04-a5d2-11ec-b909-0242ac120002 generated by the sample code, the full sample request and parameters are below.

}
```

## Step 3 - Perform actions for the user to pay

When you get the result of the [Create Payments](/api/payments/accepting-payments) API, you can perform corresponding actions.

If it's a Mixin payment, you can use [Mixin URL Schema](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/schema) to wake up Mixin Wallet to make a payment.

If it's an on-chain payment, in the JSON Response, there is a key call `destination`; this is the Address customer has to transfer the cryptocurrency. Note that if the payment assets are EOS, you can use the tag and destination from the API result.

## Step 4 - Checking the payment results

Finally, use the [payments-results API](/api/payments/payments-results) to loop query payments result; the parameter is the `traceId` you generated. And the response is the `status` of payment. The `status` has three parameters, unpaid failed and succeeded.
